        <h2>1. Demonstrate the final state of your project </h2>
        <h2>2. Discuss the key algorithms and approaches you used. What were the computational  
        bottlenecks to your approach? What would be the limiting factor to scaling up 10x or 100x 
        bigger than what you turned in? </h2>
        <h2> 3. Address any of the specific questions outlined in the description for the project you choose 
            - Your game must be interactive and run in real-time.  
            - You must explicitly discuss the connection between your game and topics from the course 
            - For at least one of the aspects of your game, discuss what the related state-of-the-art techniques 
          are and discuss how the methods you used relate to the state-of-the-art.  
            - Discuss the interaction between the gameplay design choices, and the animation, simulation or 
          planning techniques used to implement your game.
        </h2>
        <h2>4. Include an initial sketch of the project, plus an image of your project along the way and 
        discuss in what ways progress was as you expected and in what ways progress went in 
        unexpected directions. </h2>
        <h2>5. Summarize the feedback you got from your peers during the progress report and discussed in 
        what ways (if any) you addressed this feedback for the final version. </h2>
        <h2>6. Highlight the relationship between your work (or the methods used by the tools you 
        employed) and the state-of-the-art both seen in the papers you saw in your related work search 
        and discussed elsewhere in class. </h2>
        <h2>7. Suggest some directions the project could be extended in the future. What are the limitations 
        of your current versions and how might you get pass them if given more time?</h2>
